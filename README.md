> Using GitHub's Issue Tracker as a Reading List Manager

If there is something I'd like to read, make an issue with a link, tag it,
submit it, read it, close it. If it is a really good article, post, etc. add
it to the reading list.

This is just an experiment in using the GitHub issue tracker as a reading
list manager. Like any experiment, it may completely fail.

*Note: I love using Pocket, especially with its Twitter integration, but it
falls apart on a lot of programming and tech articles when it comes to
displaying diagrams and code snippets. Paper also doesn't make it easy for
others to see the articles I am reading.*
